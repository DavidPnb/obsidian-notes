## Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

Chapters 1-3 of _A Mind for Numbers_ are especially helpful in providing helpful information and additional exercises related to the materials of Module 1.

### Worthwhile Additional Popular Works

This article, and an article embedded within it, ("[Notes on Note-Taking: Review of Research and Insights for Students and Instructors](https://hwpi.harvard.edu/hilt/files/hilt/files/notetaking_0.pdf "Notes on note-taking")"), have very useful insights into how to improve your note taking.

Notice that what Dr. Mohs calls "short term memory" in his excellent article is almost the same as "working memory." Also, Dr. Mohs retains the "seven slots" theory of working memory--researchers still differ in their perspectives about this.
