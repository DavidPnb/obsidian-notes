  {"id":"Pankowski(2022)OntologicalDatabasesFaceted","abstract":"The success of the use of ontology-based systems depends on efficient and user-friendly methods of formulating queries against the ontology. We propose a method to query a class of ontologies, called facet ontologies (fac-ontologies), using a faceted human-oriented approach. A fac-ontology has two important features: (a) a hierarchical view of it can be defined as a nested facet over this ontology and the view can be used as a faceted interface to create queries and to explore the ontology; (b) the ontology can be converted into an ontological database, the ABox of which is stored in a database, and the faceted queries are evaluated against this database. We show that the proposed faceted interface makes it possible to formulate queries that are semantically equivalent to $${\\mathcal {SROIQ}}^{Fac}$$, a limited version of the $${\\mathcal {SROIQ}}$$description logic. The TBox of a fac-ontology is divided into a set of rules defining intensional predicates and a set of constraint rules to be satisfied by the database. We identify a class of so-called reflexive weak cycles in a set of constraint rules and propose a method to deal with them in the chase procedure. The considerations are illustrated with solutions implemented in the DAFO system (data access based on faceted queries over ontologies).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Pankowski","given":"Tadeusz"}],"citation-key":"Pankowski(2022)OntologicalDatabasesFaceted","container-title":"The VLDB Journal","container-title-short":"The VLDB Journal","DOI":"10.1007/s00778-022-00735-3","ISSN":"0949-877X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,15]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Ontological databases with faceted queries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00778-022-00735-3"},
