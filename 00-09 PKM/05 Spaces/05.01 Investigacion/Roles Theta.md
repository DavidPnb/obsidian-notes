# 🚀 Proyecto -> Roles Theta

___

## 🧾 Descripción
One way to analyze the semantic structure of sentences is to start with the
verb as the central element and deﬁne the semantic roles required by that
verb. (This is sometimes called “theta assignment.”) For example, a verb like
kill requires an agent and a theme, as in The cat [agent] killed the mouse
[theme]. A verb like give requires an agent, a theme and a goal, as in The
girl [agent] gave the ﬂowers [theme] to her mother [goal]. We can represent
these observations in the following way:

KILL [ Agent _________ Theme]
GIVE [Agent __________ Theme, Goal]

How would you deﬁne the set of semantic roles for the following v erbs,
using the format illustrated? Are there required roles and optional
roles?

break, bu ild, die, eat, fear, kiss, like, occupy , offer, open, put, r eceive, send,
sneez e, steal, taste, teach, understand , want, write
