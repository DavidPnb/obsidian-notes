# 🚀 Proyecto -> Structure Depency

___

## 🧾 Descripción

There is a principle of syntax called “structure dependency” that is often used to
show that the rules of language structure depend on hierarchical organization
and not on linear position. For example, someone trying to learn English might
be tempted to think that questions of the type in (2) are formed simply by
moving the second word in a statement (1) to become the ﬁrst word of a
question (2).
(1) Shaggy is tired. (2) Is Shaggy tired?
You will help him. Will you help him?
Using the sentences in (2)–(6), try to decide if this is the best way to describe
how all of these English questions are formed and, if it is not, try to formulate
a better rule.

(3) Are the exercises in this book too easy?
(4) Is the cat that is missing called Blackie?
(5) Will the price of the new book you’ve ordered be really expensive?
(6) Was the guy who scored the winning goal in the ﬁnal playing for love
or money?
