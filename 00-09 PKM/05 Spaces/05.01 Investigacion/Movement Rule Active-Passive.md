# ðŸš€ Proyecto -> Movement Rule Active-Passive

___

## ðŸ§¾ DescripciÃ³n

We could propose that passive sentences (George was helped by Mary) are
derived from active structures (Mary helped George) via a movement rule
such as the following:
(active ) NP1 V NP2 â‡’NP2 be V-ed by NP1 (passive)
Note that the tense, past or present, of the V (e.g. helped) in the active structure
determines the tense of be in the passive structure (e.g. was helped).
Which of the following active sentences can be restructured into passive
sentences
using this rule? What prevents the rule from working in the other cases?

(1) The dog chased the cat.
(2) Snow White kissed Grumpy.
(3) He loves them.
(4) Betsy borrowed some money from Christopher.
(5) The team played badly.
(6) The bank manager laughed.
(7) They have two children.
(8) The duckling became a swan.
(9) Someone mentioned that you played basketball.
(10) The police will arrest violen t demonstrators.
