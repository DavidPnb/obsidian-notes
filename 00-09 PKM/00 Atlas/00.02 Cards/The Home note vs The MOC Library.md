# The [[00 Home]] note vs [[+ Library]]
The [[00 Home|Home]] note is like the [[1942 ðŸ“š Foundation Series (1942-93)|First Foundation]], while the [[+ Library]] note is like the Second Foundation. 

- The first foundation is about ingenuity and free will. 
- The second foundation is about structuring chaos acceptably.
