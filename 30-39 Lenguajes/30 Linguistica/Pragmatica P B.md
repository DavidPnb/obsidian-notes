## 🧾 Descripción

What counts as polite behavior can differ substantially from one group or
culture to the next. Below are some basic descriptions from Lakoff (1990) of
three types of politeness, called distance politeness, deference politeness and
camaraderie politeness. As you read these descriptions, try to decide which
type you are most familiar with and whether you have encountered the others
on any occasion. What kind of language do you think is characteristic of these
different types of politeness?
* “Distance politeness is the civilized human analogue to the territorial strategies
of other animals. An animal sets up physical boundary markers (the dog and
the hydrant) to signal its fellows: My turf, stay out. We, being symbol-using
creatures, create symbolic fences.”
* “Distancing cultures weave remoteness into their language.”
* “Another culture might avoid the danger of conﬂict by adopting a strategy
of deferential politeness. If a participant decides that whatever is to happen
in a conversation – both what is said and what it is to mean – is up to the
other person, conﬂict can easily be avoided.”
* “Where distance politeness more or less assumes equality between
participa nts, deferenc e works by debasi ng one or both.”
* “While distance politeness has been characteristic of the middle and upper
classes in most of Europe for a very long time, deference has been typical in
many Asian societies. But it is also the preferred model of interaction for women
in the majority of societies, either always or only when talking to men.”
* “A third st rategy (camara derie) that has recently emerge d in this culture
makes a different assum ption: that interacti on and connec tion are good in
themselv es, that openn ess is the greatest sign of courtesy. ”
* “In a camaraderie system, the appearance of openness and niceness is to be
sought above all else. There is no holding back, nothing is too terrible to say.”
