## Levels of Usage
### Standard

Standard English can be classified as formal or informal. **Informal** English has the sentence structure of a conversation, uses simple terms, and presents a moderate amount of contractions and slang; **Formal** English, on the other hand, has complex sentences and paragraphs, and also uses technical jargon.

### Substandard

Its considered ungrammatical and its used by people with lower education.

## Agreement
Some words in English have matching forms to show grammatical relationship.

### Subject-Verb
Subject in 3rd person singular -> Verb with *-s* termination

This relationship is not altered by having a phrase between subject and verb.

Some indefinite pronouns are treated as singular, some as plural, and others change number depending on the sentence.

### Antecedent-Pronoun
The **antecedent** is the subject to which the pronoun refers. Pronoun and antecedent agree in person, number, and gender. Singular antecedents joined by *and* are refered to by plural pronouns. Singular antecedents joined by *or* are refered to by singular pronouns.
## Verbs
### Regularity
Regular verbs end with *-d/ed*
### Principal Parts
Every verb form is derived one of these principal forms
- **Present** - V(inf)
- **Present Participle** - aux + V(ing)
- **Past** - V(past)
- **Past Participle** - aux + V(part)

### Kinds of Verbs
**Action verbs** assign an action to a subject; **linking verbs** assign a quality.
### Tense
The **verb tenses** are: past, present, and future. If a verb is in perfect tense, it has the helping verb *have*. A verb in progressive tense ends in *-ing*.

Present perfect tense is used to indicate an action in the indefinite past. Past and future perfect tense are to express action completed before another action.
