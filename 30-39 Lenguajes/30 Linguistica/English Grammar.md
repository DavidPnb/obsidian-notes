### Interjection
A word that expresses emotion and has no grammatical relation to other words in a sentence.

## Parts of a Sentence
A **sentence** is a group of words expressing a complete thought.

A sentence consists of two parts: the **subject** and the **predicate**. The subject of the sentence is that part about which something is being said. The predicate is that part which says something about the subject.

The **simple subject** is the principal word or group of words in the subject. The principal word or group of words in the predicate is called the **simple predicate**, or the **verb**.

A **compound subject** consists of two or more subjects that are joined by a conjunction and have the same verb. A **compound verb** consists of two or more
verbs that have joined by a conjunction and have the same subject. The usual connecting words are and and or.

The **complement** is the part of the predicate that is not a verb or adverb. If they receive or are affected by the action of the verb, they are called **objects**. The **direct object** of the verb receives the action of the verb or shows the result of the action. The indirect object of the verb precedes the direct object and usually tells to whom or for whom the action of the verb is done.

To complete their meaning, some action verbs require an additional complement following their objects. This additional complement is called an **objective complement** because it refers to the object; it may be a noun or an adjective. 

Complements that refer to (describe, explain, or identify) the subject are **subject complements**. A **predicate nominative** is a noun or pronoun complement that refers to the same person or thing as the subject of the verb. A **predicate adjective** is an adjective complement that modifies the subject of the verb. The subject complement always follows a linking verb.

## Phrases
Group of words that together have a meaning beyond the literal sense.

### Prepositional
**Prepositional phrases** start with a preposition and usually end with a noun or pronoun. They can be used as adjectives or adverbs. These are **adjective phrases** and **adverb phrases** respectively.

### Verbal
**Verbals** are verbs used as a different part of speech inside a sentence.

**Infinitives** are verbals preceded by the helping verb *to* and can be used as several parts of speech. **Gerunds** are verbals that end with *-ing* and are used as nouns. **Participial** are verbals used as adjectives.

**Verbal phrases** start with a verbal.

## Clauses
Groups of words containing a subject and a predicate and used as a part of speech.

###  Independent
**Independent clauses** make sense without the context of their sentence.

### Subordinate
**Subordinate clauses** cannot stand alone as sentences. Depending on their function, they are classified as **adjective clauses**, **noun clauses**, and **adverb clauses**.

**Relative pronouns** are pronouns that begin subordinate clauses. They are **definite pronouns** if they refer to a previously used noun, otherwise, they are **indefinite pronouns**. A conjunction that begins an adverb clause is a **subordinating conjunction**.

## Sentences
### Structure
**Simple sentences** have an independent clause. **Compound sentences** have two or more independent clauses joined by **coordinating conjunctions**. **Complex sentences** have one or more subordinate clauses. **Compound-Complex sentences** have two or more independent clauses and one or more subordinate clauses.

### Porpuse
**Declarative sentences** are statements. An **imperative sentence** gives commands. **Interrogative sentences** ask questions. **Exclamatory sentences** express strong feelings.
