## Relationship Between Ideas
### Coordination
**Coordinate clauses** have the same relevance in a sentence and are joined by a conjunction. Depending on the conjunction, the relationship is one of:
1. **Addition** - (*and*)
2. **Choice** - (*or*)
3. **Result** - (*therefore*)
4. **Contrast** - (*but*)
### Subordination
**Subordinate clauses** depend on the main clause because they do not have complete meaning independently; if they are joined by an adverb their relationship can be of
1. **Cause** - (*because*)
2. **Purpose** - (*so that*)
3. **Time** - (*when*)
4. **Condition** - (*if*)

**Adjective clauses** can be used to give an additive relationship to sentences with different emphasis.
