## 🧾 Descripción
Let’s imagi ne you were in a situa tion wh ere you had to as k your parents if you
could go out to a dance and you received one of these two response s. Do you
thin k that these respo nses have the same or different “meani ngs”?

“Yes , of course , go.” “If you want, you can go.”

Next, consider this situation, descr ibed in Tannen ( 1986).

A Greek woman explained ho w she and her father (and later her husband)
communicated. If she wanted to do some thing, like go to a dance, she had to
ask her fathe r for permiss ion. He never said no. But she could tell from the way
he said yes whethe r or not he meant it. If he said something like “Yes, of course ,
go,” then she knew he thought it was a good idea. If he said somethi ng like “If
you want, you can go,” the n she understoo d that he didn’t think it was a
good idea, and sh e wouldn’t go.

Why do you think “he never said no” (when he was com municati ng “No” )?
How would you analyze the two speech acts reported as responses in this
passage?
Are you familiar with any other comparable situations where “more is
communicated than is said”?
