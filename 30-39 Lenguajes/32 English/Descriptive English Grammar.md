# Descriptive English Grammar
## Lexemes
A lexeme is a word free of grammatical accidents, and serves as a root to derive other words. 

### Categories
- **Noun**
- **Verb**
- **Adjective**
- **Adverb**
- **Determinative**
- **Prepposition**
- **Coordinator**
- **Subordinator**
- **Interjection**

A single word form can have different lexemes corresponding to different categories.

## Phrases and Clauses
A phrase works as a constituent of a sentence. The **head** provides the essential meaning of the phrase, and the **dependent** provides additional meaning to it. A lexeme can act as the head of the phrase, as long as it is not a coordinator, subordinator, or interjection. A phrase can also serve as the head for another phrase. A **clause** is a special type of phrase with a verb phrase as its head, and is the most important phrase in english speech. This VP is called a **predicate**.
