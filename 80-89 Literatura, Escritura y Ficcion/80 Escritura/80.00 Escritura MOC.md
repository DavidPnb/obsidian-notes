## Recursos
[Emma Darwin's toolkit](https://emmadarwin.typepad.com/thisitchofwriting/resources.html) is a good resource for writing techniques, at least to make you familiar with what's out there.

[K M Weiland's site](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/) is a good overview of storytelling and dramatic structure.

The list of books available on each topic is as long as your arm, but here are few that work for someone who wants to learn in a structured way. I'd get into the habit of always having at least one book on writing going as part of your normal reading diet.

**Storytelling:**

Story physic, and Story engineering, by Larry Brooks, his attitude is annoying, but the advice is solid and well structured.

Story, by Robert McKee, classic on storytelling for movies.

**Writing technique:**

Techniques of the selling writer, by Dwight Swain. Pretty much a step-by-step book on how to write action and adventure stories. It's an excellent foundation to build on.

Self-editing for fiction writers, by Renni Browne and Dave King. Pretty much what it says on the box. Techniques developmental editors use to help with dramatization.

**Language:**

For pure grammar stuff I recommend ProWritingAid, it's great at teaching you proper grammar and punctuation.

[The Elements of Style,](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf) by Strunk and White. Classic book on writing style. It doesn't cover everything, but as a starting point you can't go wrong.
