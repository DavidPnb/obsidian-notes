$$To determine the maximum height of a projectile shot with an initial speed of 40 m/s at an angle of 60 degrees with the horizontal using energy methods, we can follow these steps:

1.  **Initial Kinetic Energy:**  
    The total initial kinetic energy ((KE_i)) of the projectile is given by:  
    [  
    KE_i = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2  
    ]  
    where (v_i) is the initial speed and (m) is the mass of the projectile. We can ignore (m) since it will cancel out later.
    
2.  **Initial Vertical Component of Velocity:**  
    The initial vertical component of the velocity ((v_{iy})) is:  
    [  
    v_{iy} = v_i \sin \theta  
    ]  
    where (\theta) is the angle of projection.
    
     
    
    Substituting the given values:  
    [  
    v_{iy} = 40 , \text{m/s} \cdot \sin 60^\circ = 40 , \text{m/s} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 20\sqrt{3} , \text{m/s}  
    ]
    
3.  **Kinetic Energy at Maximum Height:**  
    At the maximum height, the vertical component of the velocity becomes zero ((v_{fy} = 0)). The kinetic energy at this point ((KE_f)) is due to the horizontal component of the velocity alone, which remains constant throughout the projectile's flight.
    
     
    
    The initial horizontal component of the velocity ((v_{ix})) is:  
    [  
    v_{ix} = v_i \cos \theta  
    ]  
    [  
    v_{ix} = 40 , \text{m/s} \cdot \cos 60^\circ = 40 , \text{m/s} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 20 , \text{m/s}  
    ]
    
     
    
    Thus, the kinetic energy at the maximum height is:  
    [  
    KE_f = \frac{1}{2} m v_{ix}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m (20 , \text{m/s})^2 = \frac{1}{2} m \cdot 400 , (\text{m}^2/\text{s}^2) = 200m , (\text{m}^2/\text{s}^2)  
    ]
    
4.  **Change in Kinetic Energy:**  
    The difference in kinetic energy between the initial state and the state at maximum height is converted into gravitational potential energy ((PE)) at the maximum height:  
    [  
    \Delta KE = KE_i - KE_f  
    ]  
    [  
    KE_i = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 = \frac{1}{2} m (40 , \text{m/s})^2 = \frac{1}{2} m \cdot 1600 , (\text{m}^2/\text{s}^2) = 800m , (\text{m}^2/\text{s}^2)  
    ]
    
     
    
    Therefore,  
    [  
    \Delta KE = 800m , (\text{m}^2/\text{s}^2) - 200m , (\text{m}^2/\text{s}^2) = 600m , (\text{m}^2/\text{s}^2)  
    ]
    
5.  **Potential Energy at Maximum Height:**  
    The change in kinetic energy is equal to the gain in potential energy:  
    [  
    \Delta KE = PE = mgh  
    ]  
    where (h) is the maximum height and (g) is the acceleration due to gravity ((9.8 , \text{m/s}^2)).
    
     
    
    Solving for (h):  
    [  
    600m = mgh  
    ]  
    [  
    600 = gh  
    ]  
    [  
    h = \frac{600}{9.8} \approx 61.22 , \text{m}  
    ]
    

Thus, the maximum height of the projectile is approximately (61.22 , \text{m}).$$
